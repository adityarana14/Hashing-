Q1)  Given a non-empty array of integers, find the top k elements which have the highest frequency in the array. If two numbers have the same frequency then the larger number should be given preference. 

Q2)  Given an array Arr of N positive integers and another number X. Determine whether or not there exist two elements in Arr whose sum is exactly X.

Q3)  Given two arrays a[] and b[] respectively of size n and m, the task is to print the count of elements in the intersection (or common elements) of the two            arrays.
     For this question, the intersection of two arrays can be defined as the set containing distinct common elements between the two arrays. 

Q4)  Given an array of integers and a number k, write a function that returns true if given array can be divided into pairs such that sum of every pair is divisible by k.
 
 Q5)  Given an array arr of size n and an integer X. Find if there's a triplet in the array which sums up to the given integer X.
